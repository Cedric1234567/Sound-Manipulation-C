# Sound-Manipulation-C
Description
This project demonstrates audio signal processing in C, focusing on adding an echo effect to .wav audio files. By leveraging low-level programming constructs, it efficiently manipulates binary audio data to create customizable audio effects. The program implements dynamic memory allocation, file handling, and command-line parameter parsing for precise control over the echo's characteristics.
