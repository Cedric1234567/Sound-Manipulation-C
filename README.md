# Sound-Manipulation-C
Description

This project contains two files. The first addecho.c demonstrates audio signal processing in C, focusing on adding an echo effect to .wav audio files. By leveraging low-level programming constructs, it efficiently manipulates binary audio data to create customizable audio effects. The program implements dynamic memory allocation, file handling, and command-line parameter parsing for precise control over the echo's characteristics. On the program (addecho) has been compiled, it should be called as ./addecho -d [delay] -v [volume scale] [sourcefile] [destinationfile]. The delay parameter is the amount the program waits before adding the echo into the file, and the volume scale parameter is the amount the program scales the volume in the original file to add the echo.The second program remvocals.c takes an input .wav file removes its vocals and writes the new file to a destination file.
